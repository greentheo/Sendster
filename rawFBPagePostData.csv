"infoDataTemp","<U+2018>National Burger Week<U+2019>

How much do you know about The <U+201C>Classic Beef Burger<U+201D> ?

The Beef Burger is a sandwich consisting of a fried cake of minced Beef served on a bun, often with other ingredients. There is a dispute about who made the first Hamburger and bun in America.

Have you ever wondered where the first Hamburger on a bun came from? Which story you believe depends on your definition of a Hamburger. Is it a Hamburger when served on a bun? Or is it a Hamburger when served between two slices of bread? 

Only one of the claimants below served their Hamburgers on a bun - Oscar Weber Bilby in 1891. The rest served them as sandwiches between two slices of bread.

The term ""Burger"", can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the UK where the term ""patty"" is rarely used. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat as in ""Beef Burger"".

A Hamburger (also called a Hamburger sandwich, Burger or Hamburg) is a sandwich consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat (usually beef, but occasionally pork or a combination of meats) usually placed inside a sliced bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with lettuce, bacon, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese and condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup and relish.

The term Hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, from where many people Emigrated to the United States. In High German, <U+2018>Burg<U+2019> means fortified settlement or fortified refuge; and is a widespread component of place names. Hamburger can be a descriptive noun in German, referring to someone from Hamburg.

Brief History Of the Burger/Hamburger

1937: Patrick McDonald opens a Hamburger and drinks stand called ""The Airdrome"" on historic Route 66 (now Huntington Drive) near the Monrovia Airport in Monrovia, California.
Throughout  the 1940<U+2019>s The McDonald's concept was introduced in San Bernardino, California by Dick and Mac McDonald of Manchester, New Hampshire. It was modified and expanded by their business partner, Ray Kroc, of Oak Park, Illinois, who later bought out the business interests of the McDonald brothers in the concept and went on to found McDonald's Corporation.

In the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.

1963: McDonald's sells its one billionth Hamburger.
1970<U+2019>s <U+2013> McDonald<U+2019>s goes Global!!!!

 Reviewed 12 April 2012 NEW 
Booked this hotel at short notice because of location and availability of parking while visiting daughter who lives in a flat nearby. It delivered above expectations. A warm welcome including use of name on arrival suggesting we were expected (very rare even though you are almost always booked in advance). Efficient check in process taking a minute or so (why do so many hotels make such a meal of this). The size of the room, big by any standards but huge for London. Downside to be aware of is the lack of lift to 2nd floor - not a problem for us but could be for others.

"infoDataTemp","It<U+2019>s nearly time for the highlight of our whole year here at the Orange Tree. You<U+2019>ve guessed it <U+2013> the Six Nations will be starting soon, and we<U+2019>ll be showing every single game on our two great big HD screens. The tournament will be kicking off on Saturday 4th February with France v Italy and Scotland v England, and we<U+2019>re expecting to be hugely busy (to put it mildly) so why not book your table now? Availability will be very limited for the two home games at Twickenham <U+2013> England v Wales on the 25th February and England v Ireland on the 17th March <U+2013> so we<U+2019>d recommend you give us a call now on 02089 400944 to avoid disappointment. No matter who you support, the Six Nations are always plain old fashioned fun, and we can<U+2019>t wait for them to get started!

"infoDataTemp","It just might be the case that we're the only pub in Richmond which isn't charging an entry fee for New Year's Eve. Couldn't get tickets for anywhere else? Come to the Orange Tree. Don't fancy paying a tenner on the door for the 'privilege' of drinking in a bar which is free the rest of the year? Come to the Orange Tree. Put on your sparkliest dress and your shiniest shoes and join us from 7pm 'til 1am and we promise you won't be disappointed.","2011-12-30T22:02:27+0000","127542450625367_292588767454067","0","0","status","86"
"infoDataTemp","It might seem like a distant prospect with Christmas looming ever closer, but we've already got our preparations for New Year's Eve well under way! We're delighted to announce that this year we won't be charging an entry fee, so no tickets are required and everybody's welcome. It won't be long before we can tell you who our DJ for the night will be, and we'll be serving and partying with the good people of Richmond until 1am. It's been a great year for us, filled with exciting changes, and we want to share the start of 2012 with as many of you lovely people as we can physically fit into our pub. We'll see you there!","2011-12-23T22:25:08+0000","127542450625367_288745524505058","1","0","status","117"
"infoDataTemp","Rugby. Yes, rugby. Irish rugby. Take a minute to enjoy those words.

Harlequins. Connacht. Two more words which ought to evoke a sense of pride and excitement. Friday night and 8pm are also great phrases.

If you aren't at least a little intrigued now, you never will be. For those of you who are now fervently reading on for fixture details, we won't keep you in suspense any longer.

We're showing the Harlequins v Connacht rugby match at 8pm this Friday 11th November on our gigantic HD screens. Expect chilled beer, tasty pub grub and an electric atmosphere. 

We know we'll see you there. And we can't wait.","2011-11-09T20:43:21+0000","127542450625367_264326333613644","4","0","status","105"
"infoDataTemp","So we reach the end of the road to the Rugby World Cup final tomorrow. It's been a strange old tournament for us Europeans, what with the time difference meaning some of the games were at a truly ungodly hour. However, we've loved every one of you who made it to the Orange Tree, sometimes even at 5.30am, to support your teams and watch with us even though you could have been in bed with a cup of tea.

While watching at home is all well and good, you can't deny that the atmosphere of a packed-out pub with all eyes fixed on the big screens, cheering and applauding over pints of Guinness. That's why we think you should all make one last push to come and join us tomorrow morning for New Zealand vs France. We open doors at 8.30am (not too painful!) for what promises to be a really exciting final. We'll be serving breakfast from 9am, and every Full English ordered comes with a free coffee, tea or soft drink. The bar will be open early too - it always feels naughty to have a drink in the morning, and it adds to the sense of occasion!

Hoping to see you there tomorrow whether you're waving the flag for your nation or just enjoy a damn good game of rugby.","2011-10-22T21:27:38+0000","127542450625367_256575317722079","0","0","status","221"
"infoDataTemp","Many thanks to all the rugby fans who braved the early starts (and London transport) and gave this weekend's World Cup quarter finals a real buzz. We're hoping to see even more of you this coming weekend for the semi finals at the less ungodly hour of 9am!
    
This Saturday 15th the last stalwart of British rugby, Wales, will be taking on our friends across the water, France. And on Sunday 16th the atmosphere will be tense as Australia faces their antipodean neighbours, host nation New Zealand.
    
As if that isn't reason enough to drink lots of Guinness and cheer loudly, we'll be serving breakfast from 9 til midday and you get a free coffee, tea or soft drink with every full English ordered.

See you bright and early folks!","2011-10-10T11:49:45+0000","127542450625367_251121764934101","3","0","status","135"

"infoDataTemp","Well it has been a month of getting ready for the lighter seasons.

The lawns have been mown and trimmed, the deck and BBQ are ready to be used and the back garden is also ready to relax in during the warm evenings to come.... Fingers crossed!

This summer has lots of occasions to celebrate - The Boat Race and the Grand Nationals in April (along with the Easter weekend). In May its the Oxshott Village Day on the 7th. At the start of June we have the Queens Diamond Jubilee and then finally the Olympics arrive!

To compliment the season our menu will evolve with the fantastic British season produce that becomes available to us.

Our BBQ menu will be served throughout the Spring and Summer months out on the deck - 12 - 2.30pm and 7.00 - 9.00 each weekday, between 12.00 - 9.00 Saturdays and then 12.00 and 7.00pm on Sundays. 

(If you would like to know when we are serving the BBQ, weather permitting,  then please follow us on twitter @bearoxshott to find out daily! 

You can also relax out in the back garden away from it all in the warmer evenings to come. There will be bottled beers and ciders chilled wines, classic Pimm's No.1 soft drinks and snacks.

As always our Sunday's are about exceptional British ingredients that are treated with the greatest of respect. Booking is highly recommended as its very popular, especially between the times of 12 and 5pm 

New to each Sunday is our Private Dining Experiences for parties of 8 - 12 guests. Served in our Private Dining Room you have the opportunity to select from a three course menu, choose, carve and serve your own selected roasts with a dedicated waiter. This treat is by prior reservation and pre-order only, <U+00A3>27.00 per guest. 

Looking forward to seeing you all over this fabulous summer!","2012-04-04T15:48:05+0000","150373421667187_351563364881524","1","0","status","310"
"infoDataTemp","Ever wandered how to make our fabulous Crab Mille-Feuille, Peter has kindly passed on the recipe so you can try at home, for that up coming dinner party. 

Ingredients: 
3x sheet fill pastry 
200g cold diced butter 
200g melted butter 
60g finely grated Parmesan 
10g diced red chilli 
1x large spring onion, sliced finely
10g finely chopped ginger 
40g white crab meat
15g fine diced shallots
30g fine diced red pepper
200ml dry white wine
2g saffron strands
5g micro rocket

Method: 
To make the filo parmesan biscuits: firstly lay out one sheet of filo pastry, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a third of the parmesan. Lay another sheet of filo on top of the first and repeat again. Using a 5cm ring cutter cut out an individual disc and lay on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake on the bottom shelf of a non fan assisted oven for 6minutes at 220/gas mark 7 and then leave to cool. 

To make the beurre-blanc: heat a saucepan on the stove until its very hot. Pour in the white wine add the saffron, diced shallot and reduce for a further 2 mins. Remover from the heat and slowly whisk in the diced cold butter one cube at a time (if you add butter too quickly it will split) and then set to one side. In a frying pan drizzle olive oil and then gently saut<U+00E9>e the sliced spring onion, chilli and ginger for 2mins. Add the crab, gently cook (making sure not to colour the mix) and season to taste.

To assemble the Mille-Feuille: place a third of the cooked crab mix just off centre in a warmed large pasta bowl of plate. Now place one of the filo pastry biscuits on top of the crab. Repeat three times until you have a small stack. Top wi the micro rocket and then drizzle the saffron beurre-bland next to the Mille Feuille. We hope you enjoy this very attractive dish!","2012-03-19T14:33:53+0000","150373421667187_343012065736654","0","0","status","323"

At the moment we have both full time and part time waiting positions available at our gorgeous Riverview restaurant. As well as full time and part time bar jobs at the gorund floor main bar area. Its an exciting time to be with us as we push towards the summer and those massive events: The Boatrace, Queen<U+2019>s Jubilee, Olympic games and those hot weekends by the river.

Applicants for the restaurant must have previous waiting experience. As we are looking for front of house staff a very high level of English is required. 

We are looking for people who are able to commit for a minimum of 6 months (over the summer), which will include working throughout the key weekends (Easter, Queen Jubilee,...)

"infoDataTemp","Rugby. Yes, rugby. Irish rugby. Take a minute to enjoy those words.

Harlequins. Connacht. Two more words which ought to evoke a sense of pride and excitement. Friday night and 8pm are also great phrases.

If you aren't at least a little intrigued now, you never will be. For those of you who are now fervently reading on for fixture details, we won't keep you in suspense any longer.

We're showing the Harlequins v Connacht rugby match at 8pm this Friday 11th November on our gigantic HD screens. Expect chilled beer, tasty pub grub and an electric atmosphere. 

We know we'll see you there. And we can't wait.","2011-11-09T20:43:21+0000","127542450625367_264326333613644","4","0","status","105"
"infoDataTemp","So we reach the end of the road to the Rugby World Cup final tomorrow. It's been a strange old tournament for us Europeans, what with the time difference meaning some of the games were at a truly ungodly hour. However, we've loved every one of you who made it to the Orange Tree, sometimes even at 5.30am, to support your teams and watch with us even though you could have been in bed with a cup of tea.

While watching at home is all well and good, you can't deny that the atmosphere of a packed-out pub with all eyes fixed on the big screens, cheering and applauding over pints of Guinness. That's why we think you should all make one last push to come and join us tomorrow morning for New Zealand vs France. We open doors at 8.30am (not too painful!) for what promises to be a really exciting final. We'll be serving breakfast from 9am, and every Full English ordered comes with a free coffee, tea or soft drink. The bar will be open early too - it always feels naughty to have a drink in the morning, and it adds to the sense of occasion!

Hoping to see you there tomorrow whether you're waving the flag for your nation or just enjoy a damn good game of rugby.","2011-10-22T21:27:38+0000","127542450625367_256575317722079","0","0","status","221"
"infoDataTemp","Many thanks to all the rugby fans who braved the early starts (and London transport) and gave this weekend's World Cup quarter finals a real buzz. We're hoping to see even more of you this coming weekend for the semi finals at the less ungodly hour of 9am!
    
This Saturday 15th the last stalwart of British rugby, Wales, will be taking on our friends across the water, France. And on Sunday 16th the atmosphere will be tense as Australia faces their antipodean neighbours, host nation New Zealand.
    
As if that isn't reason enough to drink lots of Guinness and cheer loudly, we'll be serving breakfast from 9 til midday and you get a free coffee, tea or soft drink with every full English ordered.

See you bright and early folks!","2011-10-10T11:49:45+0000","127542450625367_251121764934101","3","0","status","135"

"infoDataTemp","Well it has been a month of getting ready for the lighter seasons.

The lawns have been mown and trimmed, the deck and BBQ are ready to be used and the back garden is also ready to relax in during the warm evenings to come.... Fingers crossed!

This summer has lots of occasions to celebrate - The Boat Race and the Grand Nationals in April (along with the Easter weekend). In May its the Oxshott Village Day on the 7th. At the start of June we have the Queens Diamond Jubilee and then finally the Olympics arrive!

To compliment the season our menu will evolve with the fantastic British season produce that becomes available to us.

Our BBQ menu will be served throughout the Spring and Summer months out on the deck - 12 - 2.30pm and 7.00 - 9.00 each weekday, between 12.00 - 9.00 Saturdays and then 12.00 and 7.00pm on Sundays. 

(If you would like to know when we are serving the BBQ, weather permitting,  then please follow us on twitter @bearoxshott to find out daily! 

You can also relax out in the back garden away from it all in the warmer evenings to come. There will be bottled beers and ciders chilled wines, classic Pimm's No.1 soft drinks and snacks.

As always our Sunday's are about exceptional British ingredients that are treated with the greatest of respect. Booking is highly recommended as its very popular, especially between the times of 12 and 5pm 

New to each Sunday is our Private Dining Experiences for parties of 8 - 12 guests. Served in our Private Dining Room you have the opportunity to select from a three course menu, choose, carve and serve your own selected roasts with a dedicated waiter. This treat is by prior reservation and pre-order only, <U+00A3>27.00 per guest. 

Looking forward to seeing you all over this fabulous summer!","2012-04-04T15:48:05+0000","150373421667187_351563364881524","1","0","status","310"
"infoDataTemp","Ever wandered how to make our fabulous Crab Mille-Feuille, Peter has kindly passed on the recipe so you can try at home, for that up coming dinner party. 

Ingredients: 
3x sheet fill pastry 
200g cold diced butter 
200g melted butter 
60g finely grated Parmesan 
10g diced red chilli 
1x large spring onion, sliced finely
10g finely chopped ginger 
40g white crab meat
15g fine diced shallots
30g fine diced red pepper
200ml dry white wine
2g saffron strands
5g micro rocket

Method: 
To make the filo parmesan biscuits: firstly lay out one sheet of filo pastry, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a third of the parmesan. Lay another sheet of filo on top of the first and repeat again. Using a 5cm ring cutter cut out an individual disc and lay on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake on the bottom shelf of a non fan assisted oven for 6minutes at 220/gas mark 7 and then leave to cool. 

To make the beurre-blanc: heat a saucepan on the stove until its very hot. Pour in the white wine add the saffron, diced shallot and reduce for a further 2 mins. Remover from the heat and slowly whisk in the diced cold butter one cube at a time (if you add butter too quickly it will split) and then set to one side. In a frying pan drizzle olive oil and then gently saut<U+00E9>e the sliced spring onion, chilli and ginger for 2mins. Add the crab, gently cook (making sure not to colour the mix) and season to taste.

To assemble the Mille-Feuille: place a third of the cooked crab mix just off centre in a warmed large pasta bowl of plate. Now place one of the filo pastry biscuits on top of the crab. Repeat three times until you have a small stack. Top wi the micro rocket and then drizzle the saffron beurre-bland next to the Mille Feuille. We hope you enjoy this very attractive dish!","2012-03-19T14:33:53+0000","150373421667187_343012065736654","0","0","status","323"

The Albion on New Bridge Street (www.thealbionlondon.com) is but a hop, skip & jump away from Blackfriars tube and City Thameslink stations, and the Paternoster in Paternoster Square(www.thepaternoster.com) is little more than a discus throw from St Pauls. Pop in and say hi to some of the friendliest people in the City","2012-04-18T15:35:19+0000","161475840546978_235182203255541","1","0","link","77"
"infoDataTemp","How was everyone's weekend? Already planning the next one? As a special treat, why not have a go at creating the perfect Pork Crackling courtesy of our friends at Dingley Dell. Here's a top tip: use belly!

1. Pre-heat your oven to 150<U+2019>C. 

2. Take the skin off the belly but make sure there is a small amount of fat there still; your butcher can do this for you to save the hassle. 

3. Score gently as you don<U+2019>t want to cut through the skin all the way, then cut the skin into 2 cm strips and lay on a wire rack. 

4. Liberally apply good quality sea salt to the pork and place in the oven for 45 minutes. 

Now you can relax until the pinger goes, therefore a chilled glass of cider would probably help at this point. The crackling will bubble up and be really crunchy and tasty, great for presentation too!

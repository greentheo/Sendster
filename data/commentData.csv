Harlequins. Connacht. Two more words which ought to evoke a sense of pride and excitement. Friday night and 8pm are also great phrases.

If you arent at least a little intrigued now, you never will be. For those of you who are now fervently reading on for fixture details, we wont keep you in suspense any longer.

Were showing the Harlequins v Connacht rugby match at 8pm this Friday 11th November on our gigantic HD screens. Expect chilled beer, tasty pub grub and an electric atmosphere.

Its been a strange old tournament for us Europeans, what with the time difference meaning some of the games were at a truly ungodly hour. However, weve loved every one of you who made it to the Orange Tree, sometimes even at 5.30am, to support your teams and watch with us even though you could have been in bed with a cup of tea.

While watching at home is all well and good, you cant deny that the atmosphere of a packed-out pub with all eyes fixed on the big screens, cheering and applauding over pints of Guinness. Thats why we think you should all make one last push to come and join us tomorrow morning for New Zealand vs France. We open doors at 8.30am (not too painful!) for what promises to be a really exciting final. Well be serving breakfast from 9am, and every Full English ordered comes with a free coffee, tea or soft drink. The bar will be open early too - it always feels naughty to have a drink in the morning, and it adds to the sense of occasion!

Hoping to see you there tomorrow whether youre waving the flag for your nation or just enjoy a damn good game of rugby.";"status";"4";"0";"1696"

This Saturday 15th the last stalwart of British rugby, Wales, will be taking on our friends across the water, France. And on Sunday 16th the atmosphere will be tense as Australia faces their antipodean neighbours, host nation New Zealand.
    
As if that isnt reason enough to drink lots of Guinness and cheer loudly, well be serving breakfast from 9 til midday and you get a free coffee, tea or soft drink with every full English ordered.

Ingredients: 
3x sheet fill pastry 
200g cold diced butter 
200g melted butter 
60g finely grated Parmesan 
10g diced red chilli 
1x large spring onion, sliced finely
10g finely chopped ginger 
40g white crab meat
15g fine diced shallots
30g fine diced red pepper
200ml dry white wine
2g saffron strands
5g micro rocket

Method: 
To make the filo parmesan biscuits: firstly lay out one sheet of filo pastry, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a third of the parmesan. Lay another sheet of filo on top of the first and repeat again. Using a 5cm ring cutter cut out an individual disc and lay on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake on the bottom shelf of a non fan assisted oven for 6minutes at 220/gas mark 7 and then leave to cool. 

To make the beurre-blanc: heat a saucepan on the stove until its very hot. Pour in the white wine add the saffron, diced shallot and reduce for a further 2 mins. Remover from the heat and slowly whisk in the diced cold butter one cube at a time (if you add butter too quickly it will split) and then set to one side. In a frying pan drizzle olive oil and then gently sautée the sliced spring onion, chilli and ginger for 2mins. Add the crab, gently cook (making sure not to colour the mix) and season to taste.

To assemble the Mille-Feuille: place a third of the cooked crab mix just off centre in a warmed large pasta bowl of plate. Now place one of the filo pastry biscuits on top of the crab. Repeat three times until you have a small stack. Top wi the micro rocket and then drizzle the saffron beurre-bland next to the Mille Feuille. We hope you enjoy this very attractive dish!";"status";"0";"0";"2128"

Join us for a trip down memory lane to revisit the 50s, with some classic fine English dishes from Peter and the boys in the kitchen. Fine cask ales will pour along side our celebration of English wines. 

All the while enjoy a classic ambience from the era, in the restaurant,  which we hope will be enough to provoke a little nostalgia. And in case you dont get enough time to celebrate with us, we shall be carrying this all through to Monday as well. 

For the kids there will be face painting in the hopeful sun and a handful of other delights to celebrate the weekend!

As a special treat, why not have a go at creating the perfect Pork Crackling courtesy of our friends at Dingley Dell. Heres a top tip: use belly!

1. Pre-heat your oven to 150âC. 

2. Take the skin off the belly but make sure there is a small amount of fat there still; your butcher can do this for you to save the hassle. 

3. Score gently as you donât want to cut through the skin all the way, then cut the skin into 2 cm strips and lay on a wire rack. 

4. Liberally apply good quality sea salt to the pork and place in the oven for 45 minutes. 

Now you can relax until the pinger goes, therefore a chilled glass of cider would probably help at this point. The crackling will bubble up and be really crunchy and tasty, great for presentation too!

The lawns have been mown and trimmed, the deck and BBQ are ready to be used and the back garden is also ready to relax in during the warm evenings to come.... Fingers crossed!

This summer has lots of occasions to celebrate - The Boat Race and the Grand Nationals in April (along with the Easter weekend). In May its the Oxshott Village Day on the 7th. At the start of June we have the Queens Diamond Jubilee and then finally the Olympics arrive!

To compliment the season our menu will evolve with the fantastic British season produce that becomes available to us.

Our BBQ menu will be served throughout the Spring and Summer months out on the deck - 12 - 2.30pm and 7.00 - 9.00 each weekday, between 12.00 - 9.00 Saturdays and then 12.00 and 7.00pm on Sundays. 

(If you would like to know when we are serving the BBQ, weather permitting,  then please follow us on twitter @bearoxshott to find out daily! 

You can also relax out in the back garden away from it all in the warmer evenings to come. There will be bottled beers and ciders chilled wines, classic Pimms No.1 soft drinks and snacks.

As always our Sundays are about exceptional British ingredients that are treated with the greatest of respect. Booking is highly recommended as its very popular, especially between the times of 12 and 5pm 

New to each Sunday is our Private Dining Experiences for parties of 8 - 12 guests.

Ingredients: 
3x sheet fill pastry 
200g cold diced butter 
200g melted butter 
60g finely grated Parmesan 
10g diced red chilli 
1x large spring onion, sliced finely
10g finely chopped ginger 
40g white crab meat
15g fine diced shallots
30g fine diced red pepper
200ml dry white wine
2g saffron strands
5g micro rocket

Method: 
To make the filo parmesan biscuits: firstly lay out one sheet of filo pastry, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a third of the parmesan. Lay another sheet of filo on top of the first and repeat again. Using a 5cm ring cutter cut out an individual disc and lay on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake on the bottom shelf of a non fan assisted oven for 6minutes at 220/gas mark 7 and then leave to cool. 

To make the beurre-blanc: heat a saucepan on the stove until its very hot. Pour in the white wine add the saffron, diced shallot and reduce for a further 2 mins. Remover from the heat and slowly whisk in the diced cold butter one cube at a time (if you add butter too quickly it will split) and then set to one side. In a frying pan drizzle olive oil and then gently sautée the sliced spring onion, chilli and ginger for 2mins. Add the crab, gently cook (making sure not to colour the mix) and season to taste.

To assemble the Mille-Feuille: place a third of the cooked crab mix just off centre in a warmed large pasta bowl of plate. Now place one of the filo pastry biscuits on top of the crab. Repeat three times until you have a small stack. Top wi the micro rocket and then drizzle the saffron beurre-bland next to the Mille Feuille. We hope you enjoy this very attractive dish!";"photo";"0";"0";"2595"

At the moment we have both full time and part time waiting positions available at our gorgeous Riverview restaurant. As well as full time and part time bar jobs at the gorund floor main bar area. Its an exciting time to be with us as we push towards the summer and those massive events: The Boatrace, Queenâs Jubilee, Olympic games and those hot weekends by the river.

Applicants for the restaurant must have previous waiting experience. As we are looking for front of house staff a very high level of English is required. 

We are looking for people who are able to commit for a minimum of 6 months (over the summer), which will include working throughout the key weekends (Easter, Queen Jubilee,...)
